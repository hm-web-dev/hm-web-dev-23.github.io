title: "Exercise: SQLite with Express"

## SQLite

SQL is a language for interacting with relational databases. A database is actually a file that is stored on disk. A relational database is a collection of tables, where each table is a collection of rows and columns. Each table can be related to other tables in the database (one row's data matches another row's data in another table).

SQLite is a lightweight relational database that is easy to use and is perfect for small projects. 

## sqlite3

There is a npm package called `sqlite3` that allows you to interact with SQLite databases using javascript run on a Node server. You can read the documentation for it [here](https://github.com/TryGhost/node-sqlite3).

You can execute SQL commands once you install this to your node project.

## Exercise

Fork this github repository: https://github.com/hm-software-eng/intro-to-sqlite 
- And clone it to your computer. 
- Run `npm install` to install the `sqlite3` and `express` package, since there is a pre-existing `package.json` here that specifies these dependencies.
- Change the index.js (and db.js) file so that it supports CRUD changes for this sample database. 
- Reading the README that has links to the documentation for the sqlite3 package will be crucial for your success with this homework.
- Change the README to communicate to other developers what endpoints are available to hit, which is what you would do if you wish to make a public API!
- Turn this in on Google Classroom by submitting a link to your github repo.
