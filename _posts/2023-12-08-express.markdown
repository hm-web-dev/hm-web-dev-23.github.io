## Express

[Express](https://expressjs.com/) is a Node framework that allows you to run a server and expose endpoints for users to access. In other words, it allows you to create an API!

This problem set allows you to practice:

- Writing Javascript programs
- Building Node projects with npm
- Using express to expose REST endpoints
- Using Postman to test an API

## Exercise

Write an API with the following `GET` endpoints. Each endpoint takes at least one JSON **parameter**: an array of numbers with the key `array`, and then a value that is an array of numbers. For example, `{"array": [1,2,3]}`. 

1. `/add` returns the sum of the array
2. `/product` returns the product of the array
3. `/evens` returns an array of all even numbers of the original array
4. `/min` and `/max` should return the min/max number of the array, respectively
5. `/sort` should take an additional boolean parameter `ascending` in the request JSON, and return the correctly sorted array of numbers
6. `/target` should take an additional number parameter `target` , and return whether there are two numbers in the array that sum to target

Your code should use higher order functions where appropriate. For example, `reduce` will be very useful!
You should be using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/postman-agent/) to test each endpoint as you're writing this code.

## Submission

Create a github repo for your API that has

1. Your `index.js` file, AND your `node_modules` ignored. 
2.  A `README.md` that describes your Postman tests (or you can link directly to postman)
