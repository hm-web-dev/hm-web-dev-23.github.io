Work together with your team to write a team contract. This is something you should all agree on and contribute to.
Your team contract should include (but is not limited to):
- schedules and skills
- general meeting schedule
- individual responsibilities
- how individuals will be held accountable
- how to handle conflict when it arises

## Other requirements
1. Markdown headers, links, and tables used meaningfully. 
2. In the team contract, commit a screenshot of a git push or copy/paste the `git` terminal commands that were done. 

## Turn in Instructions
1. Decide on ONE github repository to make commits to.  
2. Have at least 2 members make commits to the Readme.md to your team contract. 
3. Have 1 member send me the link to that readme.
