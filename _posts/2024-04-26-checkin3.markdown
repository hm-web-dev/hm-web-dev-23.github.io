# Check-in 3 Instructions

Each team should submit a document that contains the following information as well as some working code on Github. Your responses should be brief (1-2 paragraphs max). You may use bullet points.

Due Date: May 8th, 2024

## Artifacts

1. Links to your Google Drive / Github / documents
   - should include code, diagrams, meeting notes, etc

## Reflection

1. This check-in should be a big milestone for you. You should have completed your MVP. Has your team accomplished this? 
2. What are the features that you were planning to add beyond your MVP? Have they changed now that you have a better understanding of where your project is?

## Plan

1. How will your team address the issues that came up?
2. What are concrete goals for your team to accomplish before the next check-in? These goals should be small, achievable, and in priority order.

## Present

Each project team will work with another team (Ms. Feng will assign them) and you will have time to present to each other.

   1. Give a mini-demo of your MVP.
   2. Outline what feedback you would like (on a specific front end component, some user click behavior, or back-end data modeling).
   3. Give time for the other team to poke around and give that feedback.
