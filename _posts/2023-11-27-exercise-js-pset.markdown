## Cart JS Javascript Pset

WE WANT MOAR FUNCTIONS! This is to get you to very comfortable writing functions in Javascript.
I will demonstrate how to roll functions that other apps can talk to each other into an API later.

<a href="../../../Cart.js" download> Download this file</a> which is called `Cart.js`, and execute it with `node`. It has a sample JSON object that has a list of (non-sensical) items in a cart to test your functions that you need to fill in for a grade. Turn this file in on Google Classroom.
